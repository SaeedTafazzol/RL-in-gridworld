# RL-in-gridworld
agent should learn optimal policies in grid world using reinforcement learning algorithm



To implement this project I used opencv library.


How to install opencv: [here](https://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv3-on-ubuntu/)

If the libraries are installed compile and run the project:

```bash
make
./rl
```

It will learn the optimal policy after too many iterations
